## Introduction

ElasticSearch is a powerful search engine used for various applications, including log and data analytics. To ensure high availability and fault tolerance, it's essential to set up an ElasticSearch cluster with multiple nodes. ElasticSearch-HA-Automation simplifies this process by automating the setup and management of an HA ElasticSearch cluster.

## Features

- Automated deployment of an ElasticSearch High Availability cluster.
- Supports configuration of multiple ElasticSearch nodes.
- Streamlines the setup process to save time and reduce errors.
- Ensures data redundancy and reliability.
- Provides a foundation for scalable ElasticSearch deployments.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with ElasticSearch-HA-Automation.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Linux-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, CentOS)
- Ansible installed on your local machine
- SSH access to target servers for ElasticSearch deployment

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```diff
git clone https://github.com/Adarsh-Suvarna/ElasticSearch-HA-Automation.git
```

1. Change to the project directory:

```diff
cd ElasticSearch-HA-Automation
```

2. Customize the configuration:

Modify the ```inventory.ini``` file to specify the target servers for ElasticSearch nodes.
Update the elasticsearch.yml file to configure ElasticSearch settings.
Run the automation script:

```diff
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini elasticsearch-ha.yml
```
ElasticSearch-HA-Automation will automate the deployment of an HA ElasticSearch cluster based on your configuration.

Usage
After following the installation steps, you will have a fully functional ElasticSearch High Availability cluster. You can interact with the cluster through the ElasticSearch REST API or by configuring your applications to use it as a backend search engine.

Example:

bash
Copy code
# Access the ElasticSearch cluster on a specific node
curl -X GET http://localhost:9200
For more information on how to use ElasticSearch, refer to the ElasticSearch documentation.

Configuration
You can customize the ElasticSearch cluster configuration by modifying the elasticsearch.yml file. Ensure that you have reviewed the ElasticSearch documentation for available configuration options.
